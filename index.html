    <h3>A Bit More About Me...</h3>
    <p>Now that you've navigated through my little game, let me spare you further grief by telling you a bit about myself.</p>
    <p>I have been in and out of tech all my career. Most recently, my "tech" has consisted of installing, maintaining, and supporting products for the water and wastewater industries.  Most of my career, however, has been with "actual" tech companies like...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Concurrent (merged with Masscomp. Realtime Unix...)</li>
      <li>DEC (remember them?)</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.windriver.com/" target="_blank">Wind River</a> (an Intel subsidiary. Realtime embedded software and tools.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My degree is in Computer Science and programming has always been my primary passion. I'm excited to have begun the process of re-tooling my skills for today's tech job market. I'm eager to join a team doing awesome things and making the world a better, more enjoyable place.</p>
