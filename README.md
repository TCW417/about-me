## Sources

## Approach

This program asks five questions about me (Tracy Williams). The user story is something like, "I'd like you to get to know me better so here are some questions to spur conversation."  

## Version History

- April 5, 2018. pair assignment(Kevin, Tracy). We collaborated, assembled function statements. Kevin drove, Tracy navigated. 

- April 4, 2018. Day 3 lab. added two more guessing games: Guess a number (number of my grand kids) and a Washington city I've lived in. Replaced reduandant code with simpler code inside for loops. Brought project up to Day 2 level (I'd missed some of the user story requirements).

- April 3, 2018. Initial working version. Simple CSS. Code uses arrays and is ready for implementation of for loops.
