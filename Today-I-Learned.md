## Today I learned...

This is my journal entry for Wednesday, April 4th. Hopefully I'm following the instructions correctly...

Last night on the bus ride home I realized that I haven't had a single thought about my former job or employer. I KNOW I'm in the right place, doing what I should be doing. ZERO second thoughts. This is exciting.

I've nearly always felt like I hadn't figured out what I was going to do when I grew up, and I'm going to be 60 in a couple weeks!  I don't feel that way any more.

Other stuff: I'm definitely a sanbox style learner. I like to read about stuff, but I really learn by doing. Thus Repl.it and codepen.io are really cool. Just wish repl.it did parameter completion like vs does.
